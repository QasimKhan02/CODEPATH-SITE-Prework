## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[An outside source I used is reddit. I searched through multiple forums to help me understand more what HTML, JS, and CSS actually is.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[One of the challenges I encountered was understanding the work I am actually doing. Without the instructions, I would not know what my code really meant. The instructions helped me insanely with what I need to do. Another challenge I encountered was coding the prework in my own way. I did not just want to copy and paste what the instructions was telling me, instead I tried making it as unique as I can. One way I achieved that is by changing the colors, sounds, and also the "ID" values of some codes. Lastly, the biggest challenge I occurred, was when my code was not working. When I believed I finished coding, I tried starting up my game, and it would work, but no noise and none of the colored boxes lit up. I was frustrated, but decided to contact a good friend, and he explained to me what I was missing. It was a simple mistake, all I missed was one “ID” value.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I have a couple questions about web development after completing the prework. One of my questions is, how can we implement a way where a user competes with another in a live match. Would all we add to the code is a way for the server to keep track of both users' scores? Another question I had is, is there a way to implement a code so that when a sound/box is lit, it always tracks how long that sound went off for, so the user would have to click that box for the same amount of time.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had more time to work on the project, I’d try making the game look more appealing. Another thing I would like to add, is a timer so the user can keep track of how long they are taking for each guessing round. Lastly, if I had more time, I’d implement a leaderboard system, where users can see other users and their own previous scores.]
